YouTube has been pushing me a lot Emacs related contents.  This is weird since mostly I watch Vim videos only.  But probably this is also a great opportunity to try Emacs again.

I have tried Emacs half year ago.  I looked a lot Elisp programming fundamentals and tried a few Emacs configurations from others including Doom Emacs.  However, it didn't last long since I found that I didn't have enough time to configure this Emacs setup as good as the [[https://github.com/peromage/rice.vim][Vim setup]] that I was using.  Also using other's configurations makes things complicated for me.  They have too many packages included and I don't know what they are.

After watching a bunch of Emacs videos I decided to pick it up this time, with vanilla Emacs starting from scratch.  The reason why I make my mind this time is because I found Emacs can perfectly and elegantly solve some problems that pain my ass:

- More convenient package management.
- High quality packages.
- Easier file management in shell environment within the editor (Dired)
- No third party dependencies like Node.js and Python.  The two major plugs that I'm using in Vim are [[https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim][Coc]] and [[https://github.com/Yggdroot/LeaderF][Leaderf]].  They require Node.js and Python to work.  Since Elisp is power enough, Emacs can handle this easily by itself.
- Server-client architecture.  I can even replace Tmux with Emacs now.  NeoVim has the similar concept but it cannot match what Emacs has.
- Graphical interface in X mode.  This makes Emacs be able to display rich contents.
- Org mode.  It looks great to organize todo list and take notes without switching to other applications.
- Evil mode.  No need to worry about missing Vim's features.
- Magit.  Looks way better and nicer than fugitive.
- Elisp.  Elisp is fun ðŸ˜‰.

The migration is going slowly.  Right now my main setup is still Vim + Tmux.  There is a little curve learning from vanilla edition of Emacs, but It's not a big deal compared with the first time when I started learning Vim ðŸ™‚.

In the end, dont't give me wrong.  Vim and Emacs both are great text editor.  For me, Vim is more like a spirit, a concept.  Once you've learned its high-efficiency key maps, you can use it everywhere.  Even though I switch to Emacs I still use Vim mode together with Emacs' powerful extendability.  Why not?
