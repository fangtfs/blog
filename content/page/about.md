# Me

I'm currently working as a developer for one of the well-known automotive companies.

The reason why I chose to become a programmer is simply for the fun of it. Yes, the man who is driven by his curiosity.

I believe life is full of adventures. I'll keep chasing for new challenges.

Words from one of my favorite video games, for you traveler, as a gift, "May the sapphire star lights your wayâœ¨".

I wish you have a wonderful life.
