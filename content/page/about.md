# Me

I'm currently working as a C++ developer for one of the well-known automotive companies.

I like programming simply for the fun of it like Saitama sensei, but the only difference is I have much more hair than he does üòè.

A little OCD which annoys me a lot sometimes.

Life is beautiful and I'm enthusiastic about it.

I wish you have a wonderful life.
