Troubles When exporting photos from Google Photo, a bunch of JSON files come with your photos. Those JSON files contain metadata which is supposed to be stored with your photo files. If you simple import those photo files into another photo manager you will most likely not get a chronological view. Obviously, Google does on purpose so that you will not leave it easily. However, there is a workaround that is able to merge those metadata into your photos.</description></item></channel></rss>
