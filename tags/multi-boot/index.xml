There are a lot tools out there already but I don&amp;rsquo;t really like them. At least, I mean, they are too flashy to me. A beautiful boot menu seems not to be attractive. What I need is just a simple and practical maybe a little ugly boot device.</description></item><item><title>Dual-booting Windows VHD and Native Linux on a BIOS+GPT PC</title><link>https://peromage.github.io/p/dual-booting-windows-vhd-and-native-linux-on-a-bios-gpt-pc/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jul 2021 16:40:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peromage.github.io/p/dual-booting-windows-vhd-and-native-linux-on-a-bios-gpt-pc/</guid><description>Background Previously I wrote a post for this dual-boot scenario. It is a little outdated. In the past year I mostly worked in the Linux environment on my old laptop, so the Windows seems not to be a necessity which occupies a dedicated partition. However, sometimes it is still needed. That is why I started thinking to improve this setup even further.
Starting from Windows 7, Windows supports boots from a VHD file which makes it so much easier to manage.</description></item></channel></rss>
