It is a little outdated. In the past year I mostly worked in the Linux environment on my old laptop, so the Windows seems not to be a necessity which occupies a dedicated partition. However, sometimes it is still needed. That is why I started thinking to improve this setup even further.
Starting from Windows 7, Windows supports boots from a VHD file which makes it so much easier to manage.</description></item></channel></rss>
