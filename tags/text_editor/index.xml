This is weird since mostly I watch Vim videos only. But probably this is also a great opportunity to try Emacs again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have tried Emacs half year ago. I looked a lot Elisp programming fundamentals and tried a few Emacs configurations from others including Doom Emacs. However, it didn&amp;rsquo;t last long since I found that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough time to configure this Emacs setup as good as the &lt;a href="https://github.com/peromage/rice.vim">Vim setup&lt;/a> that I was using. Also using other&amp;rsquo;s configurations makes things complicated for me. They have too many packages included and I don&amp;rsquo;t know what they are.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
