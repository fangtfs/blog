This is weird since mostly I watch Vim videos only. But probably this is also a great opportunity to try Emacs again.
I have tried Emacs half year ago. I looked a lot Elisp programming fundamentals and tried a few Emacs configurations from others including Doom Emacs. However, it didn&amp;rsquo;t last long since I found that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough time to configure this Emacs setup as good as the Vim setup that I was using.</description></item></channel></rss>
